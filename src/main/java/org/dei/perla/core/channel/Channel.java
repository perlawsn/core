/**
 * <p>
 * An abstract communication channel between <code>FPC</code>s and physical
 * devices. Each concrete <code>Channel</code> implementation manages a single
 * communication protocol. Concrete <code>Channel</code> instances are created
 * by means of a <code>ChannelFactory</code>. Each <code>Channel</code> instance
 * is meant to be used by a single <code>FPC</code> only.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Channel</code> invocations are asynchronous by nature; Users send
 * requests by means of the <code>submit</code> method, and retrieve results by
 * means of <code>IOHandler</code>s. Request execution may be monitored or
 * cancelled using the <code>IOTask</code> object returned upon submitting a new
 * <code>IORequest</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>Channel</code> is also designed to handle asynchronous data
 * transfer operations initiated by the remote device, a scenario that may
 * present itself whenever the node independently streams a series of data
 * records to the PerLa system. <code>Payload</code> data corresponding to such
 * communications is made available to a single <code>IOHandler</code>
 * registered with the <code>setAsyncIOHandler</code> method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Channel</code> classes should implement a complete communication
 * protocol that allows the <code>FPC</code> to effectively and efficiently
 * communicate with the remote device or service that they abstract. Therefore,
 * PerLa programmers should favour the implementation of multiple high-level,
 * moderately specialized <code>Channel</code>s over a limited set of generic,
 * multipurpose <code>Channel</code>s, since the latter design would put too
 * much overhead on both the <code>FPC</code> and device descriptor writer.
 * Ideally, PerLa <code>Channel</code>s should implement protocols corresponding
 * to the Application layer of the OSI model.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Moving protocol information information in the <code>Channel</code> is
 * beneficial in that it promotes use of readily available third-party
 * communication libraries. As an example, a <code>Channel</code> implementation
 * of the FTP protocol could use one of the immediately available FPT Java
 * libraries. This would not be feasible if application and transport logic were
 * to be split between the <code>FPC</code> and the <code>Channel</code>.
